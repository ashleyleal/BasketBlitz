# ECE243-BasketBlitz
ECE243 Final Project

Proposal:
Two players shoot basketballs into the hoop in a projectile motion on the VGA, with release controlled by the PS2 keyboard arrow keys and the position of the player adjusted by buttons on the DE1-SoC board. Points are awarded based on the number of goals scored within the time limit. Moving hoops (more than one) at higher levels increase difficulty and award more points. The sound of a cheering crowd may be incorporated.
