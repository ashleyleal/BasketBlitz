# BasketBlitz

BasketBlitz is a two-player basketball game written in C for the DE1-SoC board designed to offer players an immersive experience of competing against each other in a timed basketball shooting contest. This game utilizes the PS2 keyboard with interrupts for controls, as well as the hardware timer with interrupts to handle game time. Double buffering is utilized to dynamically show graphics on the VGA.
